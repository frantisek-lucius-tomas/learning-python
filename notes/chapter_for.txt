the list data type

a list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. the
term list value refers to the list itself (which is a value that can be stored in a
variable or passed to a function like any other value), not the values inside
the list value. a list value looks like this: ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'].
just as string values are typed with quote characters to mark where the
string begins and ends, a list begins with an opening square bracket and
ends with a closing square bracket, []. values inside the list are also called
items. items are separated with commas (that is, they are comma-delimited).
